# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to **Physical AI** and **Embodied Intelligence**. This book explores the fascinating frontier where artificial intelligence meets the physical world, covering everything from theoretical foundations to real-world implementations.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI is the science and engineering of creating intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that exists only in digital form, Physical AI requires both a "brain" and a "body" to interact with and understand the real world.

## What You'll Discover

In this book, you'll explore:

- **Embodied Intelligence**: How the physical form shapes intelligence
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Why human-like forms are optimal for human environments
- **Implementation Techniques**: Practical approaches to building Physical AI systems
- **Real-World Applications**: How Physical AI is transforming industries

## Getting Started

The journey begins with understanding the fundamental shift from digital-only AI to embodied systems. Start with Chapter 1 to explore the core concepts of embodied intelligence, then progress through the book at your own pace.

Each chapter includes:
- Clear learning objectives
- Key terminology explanations
- Practical exercises to reinforce your understanding
- Further reading for deeper exploration
