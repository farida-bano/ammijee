# Chapter 9: Language Interface for Robots

## Learning Objectives
- [ ] Understand the role of speech recognition in human-robot interaction.
- [ ] Learn how to use Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to interpret robot commands.
- [ ] Explore the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning.
- [ ] Grasp the process of translating natural language commands into ROS 2 action sequences.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Chapter 8: Navigation & Motion Planning.
- Basic understanding of natural language processing (NLP) concepts.

## Section 1: Hearing and Understanding

### Theory Explanation
For a robot to be a truly intelligent assistant, it needs to understand human commands. This starts with converting spoken language into text, a process known as **Speech Recognition**. Tools like **OpenAI Whisper** have made this process highly accurate and accessible.

Once we have the text, the robot needs to understand its meaning. This is where **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** comes in. NLU involves extracting entities (e.g., "cup," "kitchen") and intents (e.g., "fetch," "clean") from the text.

## Section 2: LLMs for Task Planning

### Theory Explanation
Traditional robotics often relies on pre-programmed sequences of actions. However, with the advent of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, robots can now perform more flexible and high-level task planning. An LLM can take a natural language command ("Clean the room") and break it down into a sequence of sub-tasks that the robot can execute (e.g., "Go to kitchen," "Pick up dishes," "Place dishes in sink").

LLMs act as a high-level planner, translating abstract human goals into concrete robotic actions.

## Section 3: Natural Language to ROS Actions

### Theory Explanation
The bridge between the LLM's high-level plan and the robot's execution capabilities is the **ROS action sequence**. Each sub-task generated by the LLM (e.g., "Pick up dishes") needs to be translated into a specific ROS 2 action call (e.g., calling a "grasp_object" action service with "dishes" as a parameter).

This translation layer involves:
1.  **Intent Recognition**: Mapping LLM output to known robot capabilities.
2.  **Parameter Extraction**: Identifying objects, locations, and other relevant information from the command.
3.  **Action Orchestration**: Sequencing ROS 2 actions to achieve the desired goal.

## Summary
- Speech recognition (e.g., OpenAI Whisper) converts spoken commands to text.
- NLU extracts meaning (intents and entities) from text commands.
- LLMs can provide high-level task planning from natural language.
- Natural language commands are translated into sequences of ROS 2 actions for execution.

## Exercises
### Basic
1.  Research the difference between NLU and Natural Language Generation (NLG).
2.  Find a simple Python library for speech recognition (e.g., `SpeechRecognition`) and transcribe a short audio clip.

### Advanced
1.  Design a simple prompt for an LLM that would allow it to generate a sequence of actions for a robot to "make coffee".
